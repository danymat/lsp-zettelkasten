# lsp-zettelkasten


This repo is a basic implementation of a lsp for zettelksaten markdown files

## Roadmap

- [x] Support for link completion for type `[[link here]]`.
- [ ] Clickable links inside `[[..]]`.
- [ ] Support for file content preview in completion (with onCompletionResolve).
- [ ] Hover option on clickable links, in order to preview the file.
- [ ] Support tag completions with `#` character (needs a grammar).
